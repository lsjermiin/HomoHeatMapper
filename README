PURPOSE     HomoHeatMapper produces a heat map from a distance matrix with probabilities 
            obtained using Homo v2.0 (https://github.com/lsjermiin/Homo.v2.0).
            
            The smaller a probability is, the darker the corresponding pixel in the heat 
            map is.
 
FORMAT      Probabilities must be saved in a text file with comma-separated values (.csv).

            The first line must contain the number of samples being compared. 

            Each of the following lines must start with a sample name, and then followed
            by the probabilities, one for each comparison involving the named sample.
 
EXAMPLE     See file labelled 22_root_Pvalues.csv.

INSTALL     To install HomoHeatMapper.pl, type (in the command line):

            sudo cp HomoHeatMapper.pl /usr/local/bin/. 

EXECUTE     HomoHeatMapper -i <infile.csv> <-t|f>

HELP        -t = triangular heat map; -f = square heat map

STATUS      Software complete
